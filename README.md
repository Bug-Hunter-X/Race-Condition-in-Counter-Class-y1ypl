# Java Concurrency Bug: Race Condition in Counter
This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition in a seemingly simple Java program. The `Counter` class appears to be thread-safe due to the `synchronized` keyword on the `increment()` method. However, this synchronization is insufficient to prevent race conditions if additional methods are added to the `Counter` class that are not synchronized. This example illustrates the importance of carefully considering concurrency issues when designing and implementing multithreaded applications in Java.  The solution shows how to correctly handle counter updates in a multi-threaded environment.
